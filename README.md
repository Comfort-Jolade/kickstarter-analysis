# kickstarter-analysis

## Overview of Project
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trend.

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to understand how different campaigns fared in relation to their lunch date and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
This analysis will guide Louise’s decision in her fundraising goal in a short amount of time. The analysis is focused on how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. With the chart below we are able to visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. 

	
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The theater campaign was most successful in May with a succesful outcome of 111 and the next is June with successful outcome of 100 while and least successful was in Novemeber.	
The cancelled theatre campaigns were very low compared to the successful and failed outcomes.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The theater campaign with subcategory plays and funding goal less than $1000 has 76% successful outcome which is the project with most successful outcome. After this is the the funding goal between $1000 and $4999 with successful outcome of 73% which also considered high when compared to other funding goals.
None of the plays subcategory campaign funding goal was canceled.
The funding goal between $45,000 and $49,999 recorded no success with one failure.	
The funding goal that ranges between $15,000 to $19,999 have 50% successful project and 50% failure, this imply a 50:50 chance for such campaign.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
During my analysis, the COUNTIF formular was giving result as 0, so I had to change arrangement of the criteria’s, putting the goal first then the campaign with the outcome as last.

I initially found copying the formular to other outcome with faster process challenging, so I used ctl key + R to copy the formular, selected the each column and I used the replace instruction to change the outcome type.

I tried changing the colour of my chart using the Design option but unable to customize it to the desired colour. I clicked on each line and a format option came up and I was able to choose the desired colour.

Filtering the outcomes in descending order was a bit challenging but I used the Sort option in the filter button to sort it.
	


## Results

### Outcome based on Goals.  	
The recommended funding goal is the goal that is less than $1000 which have a successful outcome of 76% of the total project and the funding goal between $1000 and $4999 with successful outcome of 73%. While the campaign between the range $45,000 to $49,999 is not recommended because it recorded no success.

### Outcome based on Launch date.
The best time of the year for Louise to launch the theater campaign is in the month of May and June, while the month to totally avoid the campaign is in the month of November.

## Limitations of this dataset.

### Outcome based on Goals.
The data set is only checking monthly outcome of just one subcategory in the theater group and therefore the recommendation is limited to the data we used.	
We can also sort the percentage of successful and percentage failed in ascending order to see a snapshot of the trend. 

### Outcome based on Launch date.
We could also compare the successful outcome with the failure outcome to further guide Lousise's decision on the campaign.

## Possible tables and/or graphs that we could create.
Bar Chat and blox plot could also give more highlight to our analysis.
