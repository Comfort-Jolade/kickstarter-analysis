# kickstarter-analysis

## Overview of Project
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trend

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to understand how different campaigns fared in relation to their lunch date and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
This analysis will guide Louise’s decision in her fundraising goal in a short amount of time. The analysis is focused on how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. With the chart below we are able to visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. 

	
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The theater campaign was most successful in May and with the most failure in November	
The cancelled theatre campaigns were very low compared to the successful and failed outcomes.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The theatre campaign with subcategory plays and funding goal less than $1000 has 76% successful outcome which is the project with most successful outcome.After this is the the funding goal between $1000 and $4999 with successful outcome of 73% which also considered high when compared to other funding goals.
None of the plays subcategory campaign funding goal was canceled	
The funding goal between 45000 and $49,999 recorded no success with one failure	
The funding goal that ranges between $15,000 to $19,999 have 50% successful project and 50 % failure, this imply a 50:50 chance for such campaign.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
During my analysis, the COUNTIF formular was giving result as 0 	
So I had to change arrangement of the criteria’s, putting the goal first then the campaign with the outcome as last.
I initially found copying the formular to other outcome with faster process, so I used ctl key + R to copy the formular, selected the each column and I used the replace instruction to change the outcome type.
3. I tried changing the colour of my chart using the Design option but unable to customize it to the desired colour	
I clicked on each line and a format option came up and I was able to choose the desired colour
4. Filtering the outcomes in descending order	
I used the Sort option in the filter button to sort it.
	


## Results

The best time of the year to launch the theater campaign is in the month of May, while the month to totally avoid the campaign is in the month of November.	
Outcome based on Goals. Also 	
The most successful funding goal is the goal that is less than $1000 which have a successful outcome of 76% of the total project. While the campaign withing the range $45,000 to $49,999 is not recommended.	
	

The data set is only checking monthly outcome of just one subcategory in the theater group and therefore the recommendation is limited to the outcomes.	
We can also sort the percentage of successful and percentage failed in ascending order to see a snapshot of the outcomes
